Sensor readings with offsets:	-2	6	16385	-1	0	0
Your offsets:	-1568	-590	1163	-1257	-26	15

Data is printed as: acelX acelY acelZ giroX giroY giroZ
Check that your sensor readings are close to 0 0 16384 0 0 0
If calibration was succesful write down your offsets so you can set them in your projects using something similar to mpu.setXAccelOffset(youroffset)
