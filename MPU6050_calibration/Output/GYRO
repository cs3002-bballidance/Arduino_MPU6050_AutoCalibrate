Sensor readings with offsets:	7	3	16391	-1	-2	0
Your offsets:	-240	2307	2200	89	30	45

Data is printed as: acelX acelY acelZ giroX giroY giroZ
Check that your sensor readings are close to 0 0 16384 0 0 0
If calibration was succesful write down your offsets so you can set them in your projects using something similar to mpu.setXAccelOffset(youroffset)
